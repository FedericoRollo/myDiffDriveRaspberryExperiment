# myDiffDriveRaspberryExperiment
This work contains different experiments with a differential drive robot.

This project aims to control a differential drive robot from the computer or autonomously using ROS.
A Raspberry Pi 3 model B has been used as interface from the input and output of the machine.
The motors are simple gear motors (The yellow ones). They're attached to two optical encoder with a maximal resolution of 40 pulses per turns.
The motors are controlled with a L298N driver using a pwm control signal
